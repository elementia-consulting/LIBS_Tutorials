# LIBS_Tutorials

This GITHub hosts the source files for the Tutorials on Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) Analysis, which are hosted on www.libs-info.com.  See the website for more information.

The files are provided by Elementia Consulting as a service to the LIBS community, and as a (not so!) subtle form of advertising.

Please use these files to further your understanding/work/investigations/experiments in LIBS.  Please reference/credit Elementia Consulting.
